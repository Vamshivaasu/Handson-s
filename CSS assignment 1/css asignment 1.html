<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li><del>CSS not neccesary</del><strong>CSS saves a lot of work.</strong>  It can control the layout of muliple web pages all at one </li>
        <li><u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS file </u></li>
    </ol> 
<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>    
<ul>
    <li>Inline- by using style attribute inside the HTML elements.</li>
    <li>Internal- by using a style element in the head section.</li>
    <li>External- by using link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS 
        files.However,<strong>in this tutorial we will  use inline and Internal
        styles,</strong> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for 
        you to try it yourself.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies to multiple elements.
    ID, on other hand, applies to style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a 
    special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p> 
<p>In CSS. selectors are used to target a specific element on a web page. Once
    an element ha sbeen targeted, a style can be applied to the element.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of selectors availabe. Two of the most commonly used
    are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be 
    applied.</p>
